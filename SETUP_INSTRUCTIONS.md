# 🔧 Fixed: YTM Calculator Setup Instructions

## What Was Wrong

The calculator wasn't working because:
1. **Import paths were incorrect** - The JavaScript files were looking for a `modules/` folder that didn't exist
2. **Chart.js mixed type syntax** - Updated to properly support bars + line chart

## ✅ All Fixed Now!

I've updated all the files with correct import paths. Everything should work now.

## 🚀 How to Run (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Download All Files
Download all 13 files to the **same folder**:

**Required Files:**
- ✓ ytm-calculator-index.html
- ✓ ytm-calculator-styles.css
- ✓ ytm-calculator-calculator.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-state.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-calculations.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-validation.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-utils.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-chart.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-table.js
- ✓ ytm-calculator-results.js

**Documentation (optional but recommended):**
- ytm-calculator-README.md
- ytm-calculator-QUICKSTART.md
- ytm-calculator-CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md

### Step 2: Start a Web Server

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST use a web server (not just opening the file). ES6 modules don't work with `file://` protocol.

**Option A: Python 3** (Recommended)
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Option B: Python 2**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**Option C: Node.js**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
npx http-server -p 8000
```

**Option D: PHP**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/ytm-calculator-index.html
```

## 🧪 Test First (Optional)

Before running the full calculator, you can test if all modules load correctly:

1. Download `test-ytm-calculator.html` 
2. Put it in the same folder as the other files
3. Open: `http://localhost:8000/test-ytm-calculator.html`

If you see "✓ All modules loaded successfully!" then everything is working!

## ✅ What Should Work Now

1. **Results box (left side)** - Should show:
   - YTM percentage (e.g., 11.54%)
   - Bond details
   - Price vs Par status

2. **Chart (right side)** - Should display:
   - Blue bars for coupon payments
   - Orange bars for principal/purchase
   - Green line for YTM
   - Toggle between Chart and Table views

3. **Calculator inputs (bottom)** - Should:
   - Accept Bond Price, Coupon Rate, Years
   - Show validation errors if out of range
   - Update results in real-time

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chart Still Not Showing?

**Check browser console** (press F12):
- Look for any red error messages
- Most common: "Failed to load module" = you're not using a web server
- Solution: Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost` not `file://`

### Results Box Empty?

**Possible causes:**
1. JavaScript not loading - Check console for errors
2. Files not all in same folder - Put all 13 files together
3. Browser blocking modules - Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all work)

### "Failed to fetch" Errors?

This means ES6 modules can't load. You MUST use a web server:
- ✗ DON'T: Open file directly (double-click HTML file)
- ✓ DO: Start Python/Node server and use `http://localhost:8000`

## 📁 File Organization

All files should be in the **same folder**:
```
your-folder/
├── ytm-calculator-index.html           ← Open this in browser
├── ytm-calculator-styles.css
├── ytm-calculator-calculator.js
├── ytm-calculator-state.js
├── ytm-calculator-calculations.js
├── ytm-calculator-validation.js
├── ytm-calculator-utils.js
├── ytm-calculator-chart.js
├── ytm-calculator-table.js
├── ytm-calculator-results.js
├── ytm-calculator-README.md
├── ytm-calculator-QUICKSTART.md
└── ytm-calculator-CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md
```

**No subfolders needed!** Just put everything in one place.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Chrome DevTools** - Press F12 to see console messages
2. **Check Network tab** - See if all JS files load (should be 200 status)
3. **Hard refresh** - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to clear cache
4. **Try different browsers** - Sometimes one browser has issues

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
1. Page loads with 2 cards on top (Results + Chart), 1 card on bottom (Inputs)
2. Results show YTM = 11.54% for default values
3. Chart displays bars and green line
4. Clicking "Switch to Table" shows data table
5. Changing inputs updates everything in real-time

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. Download the **test-ytm-calculator.html** file
2. Put it with the other files
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/test-ytm-calculator.html`
4. It will show exactly which module is failing to load

**The files are now FIXED and ready to use!** 🎉

Just download them, start a web server, and enjoy your accessible YTM calculator!
